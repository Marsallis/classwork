## INTRO to ICEBREAKER!

Two truths and a lie (7 minutes) with Instructor Demo

- Write two truths and a lie about yourself in slack

```
1. I have never seen the Godfather
2. I am barefoot right now! 
3. I make my bed every morning without fail
```

Did it work? It'll look like this:

- If you made a mistake go ahead and fix it and send it to yourself again
- When you've got it, send it out to the `partytime` channel
- Everyone will click on 1, 2 or 3
- Once everyone in the group posts we'll find out if the class guessed your lie!
- We'll do a few rounds, everyone will get a chance

## Communication Tools

### Slack

#### 4 channels

- #seirflex-ruth-classroom
- #seirflex-ruth-outcomes
- #seirflex-ruth-partytime
- #seirflex-ruth-techtalk


#### How To:

##### Communicate in one of the outrun channels:

	- @username
		- sends a notification to a specific user
	- @channel / @here
		- sends a notification to everyone / everyone currently online
    - DO NOT use these unless absolutely necessary (usually only instructors/ta's use this)

##### Communicate privately:

- Direct messages are one-on-one messages nobody else can see.
- In addition, you can make group direct messages to talk to multiple people at once, privately.

##### Other:

	- You can mute channels that you no longer need (Fundamentals)
	- You can adjust the sound / notifications of your messages

### Zoom

Our video conferencing tool!

- We use breakout rooms for group meetings
- Don't forget to mute!
- You can share your screen with us / anyone
- Grid for speaker view
