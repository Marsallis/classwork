# While Loops

## Lesson Objectives

1. Use `While Loops` in Practice
1. Explain good use cases for `While loops`
1. Get ready to build a game!

## While Loops Practice

`While loops` are scary!!

Today, we are going to complete a small exercise together to feel more confident with `While Loops`.

We are going to build a Pizza Ordering service. We will be prompting our user to tell us what kind of toppings to add to their Pizza!

Head over to your `student_examples/while_loop_practice` folder. Open this folder up both in your text editor and the browser!

## When to Use While Loops

`For loops` are great for doing the same task over and over **when you know ahead of time how many times you'll have to repeat the loop**

On the other hand, `While loops` are ideal when you have to loop, **but you don't know ahead of time how many times you'll need to loop**

Say, for example, you wanted to keep choosing playing cards from a deck until you get a spade. You don't know how many cards you'll need to choose, so a for loop won't work. In situations like these where you don't know in advance when to stop looping, we can use a `While loop`

## Get Ready for Project 1

`While loops` will come in handy when building your game for Project 1! While you are writing your psuedo code, think about whether your functionality would be better served using a `while loop` or a `for loop`! Ask an instructor if you are unsure!
