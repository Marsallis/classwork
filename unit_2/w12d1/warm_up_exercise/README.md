### Contains Duplicate

**Given an array of integers and an integer k, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that `nums[i] = nums[j]` and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.**

<br>

#### Example 1:

```js
__Input__: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
__Output__: true
```

<br>

#### Example 2:

```js
__Input__: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2
__Output__: false
```

<br>
<hr>

## Starter Code
```
const arr = [1,0,1,1];
const k = 1;

containsNearbyDuplicate(arr, k); //true

```
