# Practice interview Questions


<hr>

## 1. Find a Number!
Given a sorted (in ascending order) integer array `nums` of `n` elements and a `target` value, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index, otherwise return `-1`.


```js
Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4

```

## 2. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

You are given a `target` value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return `-1`.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

```js
Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

```js
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

```
