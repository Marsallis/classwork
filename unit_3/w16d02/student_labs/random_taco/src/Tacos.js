				'Roasted Butternut Squash\n========================\n\nVegan\n-----\n\nThe great thing about roasting butternut squash is that you just throw the whole squash into the oven, forget about it for about an hour, and the cooking is all self-contained - no prep (no need to chop up an uncooked gourd), no other ingredients and no messy dishes afterward.\n\n__Ingredients__\n\n* Whole Butternut Squash\n* Chili powder (optional)\n\n__Directions__\n\n1. Roast a whole butternut squash in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes to an hour until it is nice and soft.\n2. Cut open the squash, scoop out the seeds and discard the peel. Cut into bite-sized pieces and the squash is ready to go. No seasoning is necessary, but the sweet buttery flavor of the squash is pretty tasty with chili powder.\n\ntags: vegetarian, vegan\n',

				"Pomegranate Seeds\n======================\n\nTechnically called arils, pomegranate seeds are tasty little things. They pack a powerfully tart punch, and add some crunch to a taco that might need some textural assistance.\n\n__Instructions__\n\nYou want a pomegranate that feels heavy for its size and has a firm, tight skin. (Weight and firmness are indicators of how much juice is inside.)\n\nHere are two methods for getting the seeds out of the membrane:\n\n___The Water Method___\n\n1. Fill a clean sink or large bowl with cold water (not *too* cold as your hands are going to be working in the water).\n2. Use a small knife to cut out the stem end of the pomegranate, then use your hands to break the whole fruit into large pieces.\n3. Holding the large pieces under the water, use your hands to gently separate the seeds from the membrane. The papery bits will conveniently float to the surface for easy removal.\n\n___The Wooden Spoon Method___\n\n1. Use a small knife to cut out the stem end of the pomegranate, then use your hands to break the whole fruit into two halves.\n2. Loosely hold one of the halves in the palm of your hand, open side down, over a large bowl.\n3. Using a wooden spoon, smack the top, breaking loose the seeds, which will fall into your hand and through your fingers into the bowl.\n\nThis method is quick, but it takes some practice to be able to do it quickly without splashing juice. [Here's a great video demonstrating the technique.](http://lifehacker.com/5895852/deseed-a-pomegranate-in-10-seconds-using-a-wooden-spoon)\n\ntags: vegetarian, vegan\n",

				"Hard Corn Shells (Traditional; US)\n======================\n\nMistakenly thought by many to be traditionally Mexican, hard shells were actually popularized in the US in the mid-20th century.\n\nWhile they can certainly be made at home (if you have access to a deep-fryer), the best method of obtaining hard taco shells is to head to the grocery store.\n\nIf you line them with a lettuce leaf rather than using chopped lettuce, when the shell cracks you won't lose the contents into your lap.\n\ntags: vegetarian\n",
