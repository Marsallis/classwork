You can solve these problems using either Javascript or Ruby!


### 1.  Intersection of Two Arrays

Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

```js
Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2]
```

```js
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [9,4]
```

**Note:**
- Each element in the result must be unique.
- The result can be in any order.



### 2.  Intersection of Two Arrays II 
Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

```js
Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]
```

```js
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
```

**Note:**
- Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
- The result can be in any order.
