### Distribute Candies

Given an integer array with `even` length, where different numbers in this array represent different `kinds` of candies. Each number means one candy of the corresponding kind. You need to distribute these candies `equally` in number to brother and sister. Return the maximum number of `kinds` of candies the sister could gain.

**Example 1**

```js

Input: candies = [1,1,2,2,3,3]

Output: 3

Explanation:
There are three different kinds of candies (1, 2 and 3), and two candies for each kind.
Optimal distribution: The sister has candies [1,2,3] and the brother has candies [1,2,3], too. 
The sister has three different kinds of candies. 

```


**Example 2**

```js

Input: candies = [1,1,2,3]

Output: 2

Explanation: For example, the sister has candies [2,3] and the brother has candies [1,1]. 
The sister has two different kinds of candies, the brother has only one kind of candies. 

```
