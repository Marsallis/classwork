## Two Sum

Given an array of integers, return `indices` of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have `exactly` one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.


```js

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

```


## Maximum Size Subarray Sum Equals k

Given an array nums and a target value k, find the maximum length of a subarray that sums to k. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

**Note:**
The sum of the entire nums array is guaranteed to fit within the 32-bit signed integer range.


Example 1:

```js
Input: nums = [1, -1, 5, -2, 3], k = 3
Output: 4 
Explanation: The subarray [1, -1, 5, -2] sums to 3 and is the longest.
```

Example 2:

```js
Input: nums = [-2, -1, 2, 1], k = 1
Output: 2 
Explanation: The subarray [-1, 2] sums to 1 and is the longest.
```
